## Description
The ISS Barometer Application will be used on the International Space Station to measure and track air pressure.
The crew members aboard the ISS currently rely on mechanical barometers to take critical readings during leaks, or rapid depressurization events.
These leaks, caused by orbital micro-debris, must be found and patched or the crew would need to evacuate.
Our application will improve on the mechanical barometers by providing clear and accurate pressure readings through the iPads on-board barometer sensor.
This application is being completed for our client, Donald Pettit, and for the Capstone CS 461-463 class.
