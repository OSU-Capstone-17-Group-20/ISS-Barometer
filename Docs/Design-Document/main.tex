\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The \CapstoneProjectName will provide crew members of the International Space Station with a readout of barometric pressure, as read from the iPads internal sensor.
This application will supplement the current method of air pressure reading, the MANOVACUMETER, a mechanical barometer.
As our application is targeted toward the crew members, it needs to be highly readable, clear, and good at quickly conveying data.
Along with ease of use, the need for readability and efficiency of use are the main decision factors in our production, as well as our design \cite{probStat}.

\subsection{Scope}
Listed below are the final product requirements of this product; version one will be provided at the end of December 2017, version two will be provided before the end of May.
The optional research, referred to as O1, will be completed if time allows, and is not considered necessary for completion of the product.

\begin{itemize}
\item[V1:] Data Screen with initial pressure, current pressure, start/stop button, time stamp, pressure change (measured in sec / mmHg)
\item[V1:] Graph Screen with plot pressure as a function of time
\item[V1:] Additional settings menu that includes plot scale, scroll functionality, orientation, decimal point, as well as other other units of measure for pressure
\item[V1:] All items will be optimized for efficient reading and clear interface
\item[V2:] Graph will have pinch to zoom functionality, scaling options (to be set in settings)
\item[V2:] Graph will be able to be exported as a csv, excel readable file
\item[V2:] Graph can be compared to t-Res table, to measure time remaining
\item[O1:] Research can be done to identify low pressure accuracy and resistance
\end{itemize}

As approved by our client, these are the goals of our project, with unlisted items being out of scope.
This may be changed in the future, depending on available time, for instance, the research portion may not be feasible, due to time restrictions.
Our version one application will be given to the client, who will then be able to give it to the ISS crew members.
Although they are the intended target user, giving them version one will allow our team to improve upon any issues that the find in using the application.
This means that our version two application may have changes not mentioned in the list, as they may be specific to the users and will only be apparent after use.

\subsection{Context}
This application is being developed for use on the ISS.
The stakeholders of the \CapstoneProjectName include the client, Donald Pettit, and the current and future crew members of the ISS, as well as any NASA employees that will benefit from this application.
That includes Ground Control members, as well as testers that may authorize our application for installation.
Although there are other applications that read and record air pressure data, they have been deemed unfit for the following reasons.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Complex and hard-to-read UI
	\item Imprecise readings or recordings
	\item Lack of customizability involving units
	\item Optimized for altitude or weather
\end{itemize}
These needs prompted this project, and serve as simplified concerns that we seek to avoid.
The users of the application, crew members of the ISS, require that the application meet their needs, as listed in the Scope.
Because we will be avoiding pitfalls of other invalid applications, our application will be tailored specifically to serve the crew members.
This means that their feedback, after version one is supplied, will be invaluable in helping guide changes to be made in version two.
As a result, we should produce an application that is designed from the bottom up, for the crew members and NASA to use in the future.

\section{Context Viewpoint}
% The Context view of a system defines the relationships, dependencies, and interactions between the system and its environmentâ€”the people, systems, and external entities with which it interacts.
\subsection{Design Concerns}
% Could be setting of use [in space, iss, quick pressure change], who uses it [crew members]...
The context viewpoint is a project viewpoint that looks at the application in respect to its relationship with the environment.
For this viewpoint, the major design concerns are related to the applications use, its users, and its location.
The stakeholders of this perspective are the end users, the client, and NASA as a whole.
All of them rely on the ability of our application to be clear in how it interacts through its UI.
The end users require that the \CapstoneProjectName provide accurate data clearly and quickly, with easily understood interactivity.
The users will be reliant on this application in potentially dire situations, leaks in the ISS, meaning it must not be unduly difficult to understand or operate.
As mentioned in context section, the problem of complicated UI and difficult to understand displays are the reasons that other applications are not used.
NASA requires that this application not introduce any security problems, and that any data displayed can be trusted.
NASA also requires that the application be functional and clear of critical bugs, which could jeopardize mission safety.
The latter requirement is lessened by the fact that NASA will keep the MANOVACUMETERS aboard the ISS, as well as other redundancies, but should still be considered.
The setting of use, the ISS, introduces some interesting considerations to the design.
For instance the accelerometer will not work as it does in 1g, and requires shaking to reorient the iPad.
Also the iPad may be exposed to extreme low pressures, and should be trusted to remain functional and accurate.
These considerations do not affect the design of the application, but may be tested if the optional goals are achieved.
In addition to low pressure and gravity, the stations remoteness may also affect design, in that updates and communications will be sent through NASA and their network.

\subsection{Design Elements}
% UI design, barometer implementation, Platform(iPad vs ...)
In response to the design concerns, several design elements have been chosen to alleviate the dilemmas.
As a result of the crew members need for clear, usable design, we have decided to use Swift Charts as our plot library, and a combination of Cocoa controls, FlatUIKit, and  CRPageViewController \cite{techDocRaichart}.
In addition to specific UI libraries, we plan to design the UI with simplicity and readability in mind.
This will be judged in part by our client, and eventually by the crew members once it is deployed, as version one.
The plot library will provide the functionality that is needed, in addition to being a supported and trusted plotter.
Using trusted and recommended libraries and packages will also help provide NASA with understandable and trusted code.
This means that their approval and authorization will be quicker and therefore allow faster turn around on things such as updates.
Accelerometer issues caused by low gravity is an easily solvable issue, requiring only the addition of a button to switch orientation.
This has been a design choice, proposed by the client, since the beginning, and would solve the issue for the end users.
The other problem caused by the environment, that of low pressure accuracy, will not be as easily solved.
As our application is not able to alter the hardwares capabilities in withstanding pressure, the only option would be to alter the platform.
The options that we have considered include external Arduino applications, the iPhone 6, or the iPad Air.
The iPad has been identified as our required platform, by our client, and backed by our research \cite{techDocRaichart}.
This means our only option for ensuring the reliability of the application is to test it in a controlled pressure container.
This would require things outside the scope of this project, but may be achieved as a stretch goal, as seen in the Scope section.
The added difficulty of transferring data through NASA to the ISS means that updates will be sparse, and return data or remote data storage is infeasible.
These factors guided our decision to use CoreData and NSUserDefaults as our storage packages, instead of a remote server package, like SQLite \cite{techDocShepherd}.
The choices made for the Context Viewpoint will help optimize our application for the location and users involved.

\section{Functional Viewpoint}
% The Functional view of a system defines the architectural elements that deliver the systemâ€™s functionality.
\subsection{Design Concerns}
% Could be accuracy and precision, speed, clarity of graph...
\subsection{Design Elements}
% Could be UI Design, graph interface, language, storage information, barometer implementation...

\section{Information Viewpoint}
% Describes the way that the system stores, manipulates, manages, and distributes information
\subsection{Design Concerns}
% Could mention accessibility to csv, speed, security from errors
\subsection{Design Elements}
% Essentially just the graph storage function, and settings storage

\section{Concurrency Viewpoint}
% Describes the concurrency structure of the system, mapping functional elements to concurrency units to clearly identify the parts of the system that can execute concurrently, and shows how this is coordinated and controlled
\subsection{Design Concerns}
% Will just probably be graph running while app closed? Barometer keeping up to date, no locks on data so not really a problems
\subsection{Design Elements}
% Barometer implementation, chart library

\section{Development Viewpoint}
% Describes the architecture that supports the software development process
\subsection{Design Concerns}
% We're the only stakeholders in this one pretty much
\subsection{Design Elements}
% Language Used, IDE, packages in general

\section{Deployment and Post-Deployment Viewpoints}
% Pretty small and similar so I grouped them, easy to ungroup
% Deployment: Describes the environment into which the system will be deployed, including the dependencies the system has on its runtime environment
% Operation: Describes how the system will be operated, administered, and supported when it is running in its production environment
