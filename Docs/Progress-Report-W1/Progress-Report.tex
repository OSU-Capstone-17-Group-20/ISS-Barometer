        % 6. Fill in your abstract
        The International Space Station, the conglomerate work of multiple national space associations, including NASA, requires precision devices to monitor the many aspects of space life.
        One very important aspect for the success of life in near vacuum is sustained air pressure inside the modules.
        This air pressure is monitored by mechanical barometers, called Manovacometers, which must be visually monitored, and are no longer available.
        The \CapstoneProjectName seeks to provide a suitable replacement for the current barometer device aboard the International Space Station.
        This document will serve to introduce the \CapstoneProjectName, and will detail the problem, the solution, and the success metrics of the project.
        The sections include the Definition of the Problem, Definition of Project, and the Metrics of Success.

\section{Project Purpose}
The ISS Barometer Application will be used on the ISS to measure and track air pressure.
The crew members aboard the ISS are currently reliant on mechanical barometers to take critical readings during leaks, or rapid depressurization events.
These leaks, caused by orbital debris, must be found and patched or the crew would need to evacuate.
Our application will improve on the mechanical barometers by providing clear and accurate pressure readings through the iPads on-board barometer sensor.
Readouts and measurements will be presented in a quick to read fashion that will allow users to quickly gauge the important details.
In further iterations, we plan to implement contextualized audio data readouts by using the t-Res document and a simple Swift api.

\section{Project Goals}
As mentioned above the application we are making will provide ISS crew members with an accurate and efficient pressure reading.
Our required features follow that purpose and are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
\item[V1:] Data Screen with initial pressure, current pressure, start/stop button, time stamp, pressure change (measured in sec / mmHg)
\item[V1:] Graph Screen with plot pressure as a function of time
\item[V1:] Additional settings menu that includes plot scale, scroll functionality, orientation, decimal point, as well as other other units of measure for pressure
\item[V1:] All items will be optimized for efficient reading and clear interface
\item[V2:] Graph will have pinch to zoom functionality, scaling options (to be set in settings)
\item[V2:] Graph will be able to be exported as a csv, excel readable file
\item[V2:] Graph can be compared to t-Res table, to measure time remaining
\item[V2:] Audio data readouts that will provide specific information at regular intervals
\end{itemize}

Along with these specific features, the application that we create must be efficient and clear, as decided by the users.
The application will be used in challenging situations and must be clear and easy to understand, so that the data can be conveyed quickly and without confusion.

\section{Current State of the Project}
% If anyone can think of a better way to state this, feel free to change the heading
Currently we have an outline of what parts must be included in the app as well as the outline for when the first version of our app must be completed.
We have also created our first prototype.
This reads from the barometer and displays the current pressure in mm/Hg. It also calculates the $\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$ and displays that alongside the current pressure.
We have implemented the plot of pressure against time, and have had brief discussions with our client on design changes.

\section{Project Problems}
% Needs Rewritten
We chose to use swift and Xcode because they allows for quick development and prototyping.
This said we ran into many problems with that. For one Swift only works on Linux and MacOS.
One of our group members did not have either at the time. They fixed this with installing a linux OS.
Another problem was installing the swift libraries and connecting them with the Xcode application.
Linux needed many packages to be downloaded for the library to work correctly, this took many hours of troubleshooting as it was not straightforward.
Connecting swift to Xcode on the MacOS was another problem as well.
Our last problem with swift and Xcode is we have no experience using either.
We had and still have to continually work on improving our knowledge of these systems using online videos, guides and other resources.

For the first time we all experienced what it was like working with someone who is in the workplace.
We learned that our clients will not be getting back to us immediately and sometimes we have to wait for them reply.
This means we have to work and finish our work and send it to him way earlier then we had planned originally.
We also ran into the problems of finding the correct IEEE documentations.
Sometimes we found the document quick and easy while other times it hours and many students combined to find them.

\section{Specific Contributions}
% We need to each write ~1000 words on our contributions
% Each of our sections could have interesting code, problems faced, issues managed
% I don't know really, but from the requirement this is the bulk of the writing

\section{Interesting Code}
\begin{lstlisting}
  func startDisplayingPressureData() {
      self.altimeter.startRelativeAltitudeUpdates(to: OperationQueue.main, withHandler: {
        data, error in
          self.handlePressureReading(data: data!)
      })
  }

\end{lstlisting}

One of the main features of our application is its ability to read data from the iPad's built in barometer and display the data collected in different ways.
The way that data is collected from the barometer is quite interesting.
The process of reading data from the barometer requires a bit of processing power and time which can block other time sensitive tasks form being performed.
As a result, the measurement is done asynchronously through an object called the \texttt{OperationQueue}.
A method provided by the CoreMotion library called \texttt{startRelativeUpdates()} takes the \texttt{OperationQueue}'s \texttt{main} queue, and a callback function as arguement.
The function then appends a task to the queue to perform in the background, and when the task is complete, the result is passed into the callback function for further processing.\\
