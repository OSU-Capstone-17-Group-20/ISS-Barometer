        The International Space Station, the conglomerate work of multiple national space associations, including NASA, requires precision devices to monitor the many aspects of space life.
        One very important aspect for the success of life in near vacuum is sustained air pressure inside the modules.
        This air pressure is monitored by mechanical barometers, called Manovacometers, which must be visually monitored, and are no longer available.
        The \CapstoneProjectName seeks to provide a suitable replacement for the current barometer device aboard the International Space Station.
        This document will serve to introduce the \CapstoneProjectName, and will detail the problem, the solution, and the success metrics of the project.
        The sections include the Definition of the Problem, Definition of Project, and the Metrics of Success.

\section{Project Purpose}
The purpose of this project is to create an application, the ISS Barometer, that will be used on the ISS to measure and track air pressure.
The crew members aboard the ISS currently rely on out of date mechanical barometers to take critical readings during leaks.
These leaks, caused by orbital debris, must be found and patched or the crew would need to evacuate.
Our application seeks to improve on the mechanical barometers by providing clear and accurate pressure readings through the iPads on-board barometer sensor.
The app will display the current pressure and changes in pressure, by way of on screen digits and a plot.
Eventually, in version 2, our app will also have the capability of calculating remaining time on vessel before evacuation.
This added functionality will further assist the crew members, allowing them to make quick decisions in potential life and death situations.

\section{Project Goals}
As mentioned above the application we are making will provide ISS crew members with an accurate and efficient pressure reading.
Our required features follow that purpose and are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
\item[V1:] Data Screen with initial pressure, current pressure, start/stop button, time stamp, pressure change (measured in sec / mmHg)
\item[V1:] Graph Screen with plot pressure as a function of time
\item[V1:] Additional settings menu that includes plot scale, scroll functionality, orientation, decimal point, as well as other other units of measure for pressure
\item[V1:] All items will be optimized for efficient reading and clear interface
\item[V2:] Graph will have pinch to zoom functionality, scaling options (to be set in settings)
\item[V2:] Graph will be able to be exported as a csv, excel readable file
\item[V2:] Graph can be compared to t-Res table, to measure time remaining
\item[O1:] Research can be done to identify low pressure accuracy and resistance
\end{itemize}
These features, with the exception of the optional item O1, function as our goals.
Along with these specific features, the application that we create must be efficient and clear, as decided by the users.
The application will be used in challenging situations and must be clear and easy to understand, so that the data can be conveyed quickly and without confusion.

\section{Current State of the Project}

\section{Project Problems}

\section{Interesting Code}
\begin{lstlisting}
  func startDisplayingPressureData() {
      self.altimeter.startRelativeAltitudeUpdates(to: OperationQueue.main, withHandler: {
        data, error in
          self.handlePressureReading(data: data!)
      })
  }

\end{lstlisting}

One of the main features of our application is its ability to read data from the iPad's built in barometer and display the data collected in different ways.
The way that data is collected from the barometer is quite interesting.
The process of reading data from the barometer requires a bit of processing power and time which can block other time sensitive tasks form being performed.
As a result, the measurement is done asynchronously through an object called the \texttt{OperationQueue}.
A method provided by the CoreMotion library called \texttt{startRelativeUpdates()} takes the \texttt{OperationQueue}'s \texttt{main} queue, and a callback function as arguement.
The function then appends a task to the queue to perform in the background, and when the task is complete, the result is passed into the callback function for further processing.\\
